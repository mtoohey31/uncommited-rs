# uncommitted-rs

A rust rewrite of [brandon-rhodes/uncommitted](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/uncommitted).

Archived because while I was writing this, I couldn't help but think that the concurrency issues I faced could be solved elegantly in Go. So I [rewrote it in Go](https://github.com/mtoohey31/uncommitted-go), and that version is faster... though this version could maybe be made faster if I knew what I was doing.
